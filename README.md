# Library-Catlaog-project
:
 Library Catalog is an application which refers to library 
systems which are generally small or medium in size. It is used by librarian to 
manage the library using a
computerized system where he/she can record various transactions like issue of books, 
return of books, addition of new books, addition of new students etc.
Books and student maintenance modules are also included in this system which would keep 
track of the students using the library and also a detailed description about the books a library
contains. With this computerized system there will be no loss of book record or member 
record which generally happens when a non computerized system is used.
All these modules are able to help librarian to manage the library with more convenience 
and in a more efficient way as compared to library systems which are not computerized.
